=== NOTE: speakers in square brackets ===


* celery
  [nebras] - almost done, everything ok for tomorrow morning

* pre-processing 
  [ale] - done, 15 mins for ssf processing

* machine learning
  [luca] - the base script done, random forest almost done too
  [ale]  - got new plots
  [hiromu] - PCA calibration not ready yet, michele asked who wants to take
             care of this task
  
* network
  [beppe] - stefano & davide leo working on data production,
            almost done, ~80% completed
          - data stored in pickle files
  [stefano] - working on igraph and static plots, ~30% completed
  
* 3D visualization
  [davide] - PCA plots, almost done,  ~80% completed
           - philogeny trees graphs, started today, ~40% completed
           - oculus: it's easy, just take the code for the other graphs
             and make it usable by the oculus (almost automatic, with
             2 more lines of code)
  [nebras] - kinect, ready it works, some gestures maybe to zoom the graphs

* standards
  [andrea] - half way, they are still reading some papers, ~50-60% completed

  [marco c.] - talissa working on this, reading papers etc, ~50% completed

* django: web interface
  [federica] - templates completed, 100% completed
             - "templates are pretty cool" (cit., Federica) O_o
