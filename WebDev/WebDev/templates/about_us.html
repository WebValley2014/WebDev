			<p>WebValley is the FBK summer school for dissemination of interdisciplinary research: more than 250 students (17-18y old) have attended the WebValley camps since its first edition in 2001.<br />WebValley started as a regional initiative for high school students from Trentino Alto-Adige Sud-Tirol, and it is now grown as an opportunity for national and international students alike.<br />The team will partner with researchers from a major Children's hospital and research institutes, international experts in bioinformatics for functional metagenomics, and specialist web developers.<br />We expect to develop an open source working prototype solution as well as to explore the biotechnology and predictive modeling aspects, such as profiling and network analysis.<br />The prototype will be tested on original and open access datasets of clinical interest.</p>

			<h2 class="title-article" style="margin-left:60px">The aim</h2>
			<p>The aim of WebValley 2014 is to design a novel web platform for studying microbiota dysbiosis in pediatric patients.<br />The platform shall connect -omics data and clinical phenotypes, implementing a system medicine approach, with a special focus on the support of reproducible research within interdisciplinary projects.<br />The school aims to introduce students to interdisciplinary research by combining an identified scientific challenge with new technologies.<br />The school strongly encourages the participation of all genders and various backgrounds.<br />The WebValley Lab provides computing resources and devices to test new ways of exploring data patterns.<br />Students joining the school work in a lively and interactive environment together with a group of researchers from the Bruno Kessler Foundation and selected experts, also interacting through teleconference with other labs</p>

			<h2 class="title-article" style="margin-left:60px">Team</h2>
			<p>The project activities are developed mostly in teamwork as in a true research environment, that is informal and of high quality in resources, competence and organization.<br />Each student can differently contribute to the project with ideas, software code or data preparation, design of new web interfaces, and project presentation.<br />The team accepts a challenge by a collaborating scientist from Ecology, Biology or Social Sciences and develops in three weeks a new web-based prototype for data analysis and management in relation to a problem of ethical interest.<br /><br />The core group organizing the Summer School is a team of MPBA (The Predictive Models for Biomedicine and Environment Research Unit ) researchers and WebValley alumni from former editions.<br />MPBA’s scientific challenge is itself interdisciplinary: we developed models and computational tools for big data analytics for human and environmental health.<br />Methods have to deal with complex data patterns from next-gen sequencing, global health and environmental maps.<br />Up to millions of features or samples are used and still reproducibility must be supported.<br />MPBA projects have strong ethical impact and are deployed by a mix of open source scientific computing, machine learning, geospatial technologies and web solutions.<br />MPBA is a research unit of the FBK Center for Information Technology.</p>

			<h2 class="title-article" style="margin-left:60px">FBK</h2>
			<p>The Foundation was created on 1 March 2007.<br />FBK inherits the activities of the Istituto Trentino di Cultura, which was based on the ideas of Bruno Kessler, a long-time member of the local government and founder of the University of Trento.<br />Established by a law of the Autonomous Province of Trento, FBK operates as private entity.<br />It receives strong financial support from the province through yearly budget agreements.<br />Fondazione Bruno Kessler is charged with keeping the province of Trento in the mainstream of European and international research.<br />It does so by attracting women, men and resources at the forefront of technological development and humanities studies.<br />The foundation is also involved in bringing together natural and human sciences, a sign of recognition of the challenges faced by the knowledge society.<br /><br />Fondazione Bruno Kessler promotes:				<li>cultural activities, scientific research, technological development, with the aim of both the advancement of knowledge and service to the local community</li>
				<li>the exploration of innovative frontiers of knowledge with particular emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches and on the applications area</li>
				<li>the opening of the Trentino Region to the international scene, through collaborations and exchange activities with national and international research organizations</li>
				<li> a widespread innovation ability, involving the community and the local economy</li>
				<li>the transfer of research results: support for new entrepreneurship, for the growth of brand-new professional skills and for the improvement of public administration structures.</li>
