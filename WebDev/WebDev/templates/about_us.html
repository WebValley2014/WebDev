			<p>WebValley is the FBK summer school for dissemination of interdisciplinary research: more than 250 students (17-18y old) have attended the WebValley camps since its first edition in 2001. WebValley started as a regional initiative for high school students from Trentino Alto-Adige Sud-Tirol, and it is now grown as an opportunity for national and international students alike. The team will partner with researchers from a major Children's hospital and research institutes, international experts in bioinformatics for functional metagenomics, and specialist web developers. We expect to develop an open source working prototype solution as well as to explore the biotechnology and predictive modeling aspects, such as profiling and network analysis. The prototype will be tested on original and open access datasets of clinical interest.</p>

			<h2 class="title-article" style="margin-left:60px">The aim</h2>
			<p>The aim of WebValley 2014 is to design a novel web platform for studying microbiota dysbiosis in pediatric patients. The platform shall connect -omics data and clinical phenotypes, implementing a system medicine approach, with a special focus on the support of reproducible research within interdisciplinary projects. The school aims to introduce students to interdisciplinary research by combining an identified scientific challenge with new technologies. The school strongly encourages the participation of all genders and various backgrounds. The WebValley Lab provides computing resources and devices to test new ways of exploring data patterns. Students joining the school work in a lively and interactive environment together with a group of researchers from the Bruno Kessler Foundation and selected experts, also interacting through teleconference with other labs</p>

			<h2 class="title-article" style="margin-left:60px">Team</h2>
			<p>The project activities are developed mostly in teamwork as in a true research environment, that is informal and of high quality in resources, competence and organization. Each student can differently contribute to the project with ideas, software code or data preparation, design of new web interfaces, and project presentation. The team accepts a challenge by a collaborating scientist from Ecology, Biology or Social Sciences and develops in three weeks a new web-based prototype for data analysis and management in relation to a problem of ethical interest.<br />The core group organizing the Summer School is a team of MPBA (The Predictive Models for Biomedicine and Environment Research Unit ) researchers and WebValley alumni from former editions. MPBA’s scientific challenge is itself interdisciplinary: we developed models and computational tools for big data analytics for human and environmental health. Methods have to deal with complex data patterns from next-gen sequencing, global health and environmental maps. Up to millions of features or samples are used and still reproducibility must be supported. MPBA projects have strong ethical impact and are deployed by a mix of open source scientific computing, machine learning, geospatial technologies and web solutions. MPBA is a research unit of the FBK Center for Information Technology.</p>

			<h2 class="title-article" style="margin-left:60px">FBK</h2>
			<p>The Foundation was created on 1 March 2007. FBK inherits the activities of the Istituto Trentino di Cultura, which was based on the ideas of Bruno Kessler, a long-time member of the local government and founder of the University of Trento. Established by a law of the Autonomous Province of Trento, FBK operates as private entity. It receives strong financial support from the province through yearly budget agreements. Fondazione Bruno Kessler is charged with keeping the province of Trento in the mainstream of European and international research. It does so by attracting women, men and resources at the forefront of technological development and humanities studies. The foundation is also involved in bringing together natural and human sciences, a sign of recognition of the challenges faced by the knowledge society. Fondazione Bruno Kessler promotes:
			<ul>
				<li>cultural activities, scientific research, technological development, with the aim of both the 					advancement of knowledge and service to the local community</li>
				<li>the exploration of innovative frontiers of knowledge with particular emphasis on interdisciplinary 					approaches and on the applications area</li>
				<li>the opening of the Trentino Region to the international scene, through collaborations and 					exchange activities with national and international research organizations</li>
				<li> a widespread innovation ability, involving the community and the local economy</li>
				<li>the transfer of research results: support for new entrepreneurship, for the growth of brand-new 					professional skills and for the improvement of public administration structures.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Bambino Gesù is the largest paediatric hospital and research center in Europe, with connections to leading international centers in the sector. They treat and care for a large number of patients: over 1 million healthcare services are provided each year to children and adolescents from all over the world. Comparable to a city in its size, the hospital is inhabited by children who are treated, monitored and supported within an affordable, comprehensive and high-quality healthcare solution.</p>
