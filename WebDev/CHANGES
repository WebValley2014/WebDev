   changed options in classification and fixed classification/ml/svmlin_training.py to run all possible options 
	(except ReliefF, unknown modules needed) -> once working, relief_k option has to be added to options page

FIXED ISSUE #13: Now different classifications of same input files
   are saved in different subfolders: <MEDIAURL>/<username>/<pipelineID>/classification/<MLparameters>
   So for each ML run the corresponding graphs are shown
   changes in files:
	tasks.py
	classification/ml_pipeline.py
	classification/urls.py
	classification/views.py
	WebDev/store.py


2014-07-22 #changes in WebDevNEW with respect to git download

in WebDev/settings.py (at the very end of the file):
APP = celery.Celery('Pipeline.tasks', broker = 'amqp://wvlab:wv2014@54.72.200.168/', backend = 'amqp')
changed to:
APP = celery.Celery('Pipeline.tasks', broker = 'amqp://guest:guest@localhost/', backend = 'amqp')
for local running
USAGE: comment/uncomment either line to select execution mode

in ./:
tasks.py for Celery worker added. It runs the tasks in the folders preprocess/, classification/, and network/
Again, execution mode local/cloud can be chosen: same as above

classification files changed with those in github/Pipeline:
ml_pipeline.py
plot_metrics.py
ml/ folder (all files)
phylo3d/ folder

in ml_pipeline.py:
In ML.convert_input: Edited the otu table and labels sort command. Now sorts the tables correctly
In ML.machine_learning: Fixed the issue that random labels was always selected due to wrong kwargs handling
